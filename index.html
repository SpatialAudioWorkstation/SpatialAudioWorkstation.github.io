    <h2>What is SAW?</h2>
    <!-- <p>Traditional DAWs introduced the technology of audio spatialization, but they do not provide a good interface to design immersive spatial audio. Our mission is to provide an intuitive tool for audio engineers of all skill levels to design and export spatial audio.</p> -->
    <p>The Spatial Audio Workstation (SAW) revolutionizes audio production by integrating 3D spatialization and object placement into a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) using open-source technologies like the Tracktion engine and Godot game engine. SAW's intuitive 3D interface allows users to precisely manage audio in a dynamic visual context, enhancing creative control over sound design. Features include robust track and clip management, interaction with audio through 3D objects, and comprehensive editing tools that cater to both novice and professional users.</p>

  <h2>Tech Stack Explanation</h2>
  <p>The Spatial Audio Workstation (SAW) was developed using several open-source frameworks. Notable contributions include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.tracktion.com/">Tracktion</a> - an open-source backend Digital Audio Workstation.</li>
    <li><a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> - a free and open-source game engine for developing our GUI.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our choice of Godot was due to its open-source nature and C++ extensibility, which was crucial for integrating custom code and developing proprietary features.</p>
  <p>This extensibility is highlighted in our <a href="#interprocess-communication">message handler</a> between our modified Tracktion backend and our Godot frontend.</p>
